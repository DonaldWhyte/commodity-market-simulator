	 *
	 * When the applications wishes to read/write this value, it
	 * acquires a pointer to it using acquire(), which LOCKS the
	 * value in the process (preventing other code from accessing it).
	 * When the application is done with the value, it must release
	 * the lock using release().
	 *
	 * New copies of the value can be retrieved using getCopy().
	 * This can be called without owning the lock on the value.
